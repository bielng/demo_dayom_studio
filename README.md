# Dayom AI Studio

A full site for **Dayom Lab** — chat, translate, transcribe, and synthesize
speech for **Nuer (Thok Naath)** and **Dinka (Thuɔŋjäŋ)**, plus a full open
data library and community phrasebook.

The homepage's design system, typography, and component patterns come from
[NAATH-ARCHIVE/Ai_lab](https://github.com/NAATH-ARCHIVE/Ai_lab). The Studio's
translation/speech logic comes from
[bielng/Dayom_new_features](https://github.com/bielng/Dayom_new_features).
The Phrasebook's data, audio, and interaction pattern come from
[bielng/Nuer_phrasebook_demo_v1](https://github.com/bielng/Nuer_phrasebook_demo_v1).
Everything is restyled to a single consistent visual system.

## Site map

The app is a single Vite/React build with a tiny hash router — three
independent areas, each with its own nav and a "Back to main site" link.

### `/` — Homepage
The original Ai_lab landing page (Navbar, Hero, TrustBar, PreserveSection,
WorkSection, LanguagesBand, NaathLibraryTeaser, AudienceSection, DinkaLibraryTeaser,
ContributeCTA, Footer), with:
- Hero CTA **"Translate for free"** → opens the Studio
- A **Naath Living Library** button → opens the 3D shelf experience
- A **Library teaser** section → opens the Library
- A **Dinka Digital Library** teaser → opens the Dinka library

### `/naath-library/` — Naath Living Library (3D shelf)
A standalone, self-contained page (own HTML/CSS/JS, ships its own copy of
the Nuer dictionary/vocabulary/structures/conversation/grammar data inline)
showing all 8 "volumes" on an interactive, draggable 3D bookshelf. It is
served as a static file at `/naath-library/` — not part of the hash router —
so it works the same in dev, preview, and production, and has its own
"⌂ Return to Dayom Lab" link back to `/`.

### `#/studio` — Dayom AI Studio
| Page | Route | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Home | `#/studio` | Dashboard linking to each tool |

| Speech Recognition | `#/studio/voice` | Browser speech-to-text → translation |
| Text to Speech | `#/studio/tts` | Nuer/Dinka speech synthesis via a hosted model |

### `#/library` — Naath Dayom Library
| Page | Route | UI |
|---|---|---|
| Home | `#/library` | Dashboard, one card per part |
| Dictionary | `#/library/dictionary` | Search, part-of-speech filter, A–Z quick-jump, "Random word" spotlight |

## Design system

All colors, type, buttons, and cards are tokens defined in `src/index.css`,
taken from Ai_lab's `@theme` block:

- **Palette:** cream (`#FFFDF7`–`#FAEFD1`), amber (`#F8D980`–`#E8B53A`),
  ink (`#0B1220`–`#F3F4F6`)
- **Type:** Inter (sans), JetBrains Mono (code)
- **Components:** `.card`, `.chip`, `.btn-primary` / `.btn-ghost` / `.btn-dark`,
  `.eyebrow`, `.section-title`, `.hero-glow`, `.dot-bg`
- **Icons:** hand-drawn inline SVGs in `Icons.jsx` — no icon library dependency
- **Logo:** `<Logo />` renders `/public/logo.png`, used in every nav (home,
  Studio, Library) and the footer

## Data & assets

- The **Studio's** translation/ASR call a live, unofficial Google Translate
  endpoint; TTS calls a hosted Gradio/Hugging Face model. Both need an
  internet connection to work.
- The **Library's** and **Phrasebook's** datasets (~2.4 MB of JSON + 16 MB of
  audio) live as static files in `public/data` and `public/audio` — they are
  **not** bundled into the JS, and are fetched lazily (on first tab open, or
  on page mount for dedicated routes) via `useJsonData`, so the initial page
  load stays light.
- The **Chat Assistant** ships a small, self-contained starter phrase list
  (`src/data/chatKnowledge.js`). Ai_lab's original chat/translator components
  referenced dataset JSON files that were never committed upstream, so this
  project doesn't depend on them.

## Running it

### Option A — frontend only (no backend, same as before)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # local dev server, http://localhost:5173
npm run build       # production build — outputs dist/index.html (app shell
                     # is inlined via vite-plugin-singlefile) plus dist/data,
                     # dist/audio, dist/naath-library, and favicon/logo files
npm run preview     # preview the production build
npm run lint        # eslint
```

This is enough to browse the whole site, including the Naath Living Library
at `/naath-library/` — its data is bundled in the page itself, no API needed.

### Option B — with the backend (recommended for the full project)

The backend is a small Express server (`server/index.js`) that exposes the
Library/Dinka/Phrasebook datasets as a REST API and proxies translation, and
also serves the built frontend so the whole app runs from one process.

**Step by step:**

```bash
# 1) Install dependencies (frontend + backend, same package.json)
npm install

# 2) Build the frontend once (creates dist/)
npm run build

# 3) Start the backend — serves the API *and* the built site
npm run server
# → Dayom Lab backend listening on http://localhost:8787
```

Then open **http://localhost:8787** in your browser — that's the whole
site (home page, Studio, Library, Dinka Library, Naath Living Library) plus
the API, from a single server. `npm start` does steps 2 and 3 together
(`npm run build && npm run server`).

For active frontend development against the backend, run the two dev
servers side by side in separate terminals — `npm run dev` (Vite, hot
reload, port 5173) and `npm run server` (API, port 8787) — the frontend's
`services/translate.js` calls Google directly so this split works without
any extra configuration.

**API endpoints** (all return JSON, `GET` unless noted):

| Endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|
| `/api/health` | Uptime check |
| `/api/library/:section` | `section` = `dictionary`\|`vocabulary`\|`structures`\|`conversation`\|`grammar`\|`examples`. Query params: `q` (search), `limit`, `offset` |
| `/api/library/:section/random` | One random entry from that section |
| `/api/dinka/dictionary` | Same `q`/`limit`/`offset` params, over the 9,199-entry Dinka set |
| `/api/phrasebook` | Same params, over the phrasebook |
| `/api/translate` | `POST` `{ "text": "...", "direction": "en-to-nus" }` → `{ "translated": "..." }`. Directions: `en-to-nus`, `nus-to-en`, `en-to-din`, `din-to-en`, `nus-to-din`, `din-to-nus` |

The frontend itself doesn't call this API yet (it still reads the JSON
files directly and calls Google Translate from the browser, as before) —
the backend is there as a ready-to-use foundation for a native app, a CLI,
or a future frontend refactor that wants a single source of truth on the
server side instead of shipping raw JSON to the client.

## Deploying (Netlify)

`netlify.toml` pins the build config so a stale dashboard setting can't
override it:

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

If Library/Phrasebook data 404s on a live deploy, it almost always means
`public/data` and/or `public/audio` weren't committed to the repo — check
that they're actually present on GitHub before re-deploying.
